# Wine-Festival-Schedule
This is the 2nd project (of a collection of 77) from the Codecademy's Front-End Engineer career path course. <br>
This is a simple website in which we can observe a Wine Festival Schedule coded with HTML and CSS. <br>
The purpose of this project is to get familiarized with HTML basic syntax, HTML tables, and to learn how to link HTML and CSS files.
